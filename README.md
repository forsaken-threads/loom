# Webstuhl by forsaken-threads
Vertically integrated application builder.  Use your application to build your application.  It's a delicious blend of CLI, UI, and IDE coding.

Webstuhl leverages Laravel 5.3 and Vue.js 2 to make building data-intensive applications quick and easy.  Declare your models as Webstuhl Resources and get these benefits automatically:
1. A fully featured API with index filtering and sorting, even for recursive hasOne, hasMany, belongsTo, and belongsToMany relationships
2. Totally configurable Vue components to interact with them in the UI
3. Resource controllers to serve up the Vue components and UI interaction

Stop messing with boilerplate and integrating packages.  Put your Laravel application to work and make it do that for you.

*Well, technically, it doesn't really do anything yet. But, maybe someday. ;-)*
