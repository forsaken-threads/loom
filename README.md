# Loom by forsaken-threads
Vertically integrated application builder.  Use your application to build your application.  It's a delicious blend of CLI, UI, and IDE coding.

Loom leverages Laravel 5.3 and Vue.js 2 to make building data-intensive applications quick and easy.  Declare your models as Loom Resources and get these benefits automatically:

* Totally configurable Vue components to interact with them in the UI
* Resource controllers to serve up the Vue components and UI interaction
* A fully featured REST API, including:
  * Index filtering and sorting, even for recursive hasOne, hasMany, belongsTo, and belongsToMany relationships
  * Specifiable and configurable recursive related resource loading
  * Multi-transaction support

Stop messing with boilerplate and integrating packages.  Put your Laravel application to work and make it do that for you.

*Well, technically, it doesn't really do anything yet. But, maybe someday. ;-)*
